Some interesting code fragments to please

1. PC monitor record: 
  
  the code will record  the mouse's position and the keyboard words when the victim click the mouse or press the keyboard. What's more, the recorder can give you the window info which the victim visit now and the exact time of the monitor trace.

2. Baidu_Map_API:
 
  give somewhere ,  and the code will give you an exact position of it.
  
3. Download_Photos:
  
  we take use of a loophole of the HIT dean office's website, with which we can download any HIT student's photo. Emmm, i just help my friend find her girl's photo. LUL.
