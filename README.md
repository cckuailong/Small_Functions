Some interesting code fragments to please

1. PC monitor record: 
  
  the code will record  the mouse's position and the keyboard words when the victim click the mouse or press the keyboard. What's more, the recorder can give you the window info which the victim visit now and the exact time of the monitor trace.

2. Baidu_Map_API:
 
  give somewhere ,  and the code will give you an exact position of it.
  
3. Download_Photos:
  
  we take use of a loophole of the HIT dean office's website, with which we can download any HIT student's photo. Emmm, i just help my friend find her girl's photo. LUL.


4. face_detect:

  use C++ with OpenCV to detect the face in a picture, and cut out of it.
  myFace: open the PC's camera, and then get lots of your pictures. the program then detect your face exactly
  otherFace: use other person's picture to detect
  
5. Auto_Login_with_Visidate

  Some website's login page has the identify code, and it's difficult to use auto login script(like requests, urlib2 and so on). We use selenium to simulate the broswer and recognize the identify code. What's more, we get the alert result info, and you can use the script to brute force some website login page with identify code.
